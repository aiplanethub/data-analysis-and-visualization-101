<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>We&#39;re almost reaching the finish line. Isn&#39;t it amazing how time flew by?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today is for you. Take your time, work on the first assignment and grasp the concepts shared in Plotly and Dash. Tomorrow, the final project/assignment for the bootcamp will be released. It will be based on everything you&#39;ve learnt till now and Plotly will play a major part in it.</p>

<p>Have a productive day ahead :)</p>
