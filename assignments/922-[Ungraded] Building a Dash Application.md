<p>This is a chance to build and showcase&nbsp;a project to the world!</p>

<p>As an extension to the previous&nbsp;assignment, you can complete&nbsp;the tasks below and brush up on your Dash skills. <strong>We will be featuring the top 5 Dash app submissions in the community on our social media handles</strong>&nbsp;(Linkedin, Slack, Discuss, etc.).</p>

<p>Note: This project will not be graded and is not a necessity for bootcamp completion.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a basic Dash app/dashboard.</li>
	<li>Incorporate the gender ratio pie chart that you created before into the app.
	<ul>
		<li>[Optional] Add a drop-down of the years (2018,2019,2020) to the dashboard so that a person can select the year to observe the gender ratio. This can be done by concatenating the 3 data files and adding a column called &#39;year&#39; containing the survey year of each file.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Has the ratio improved, deteriorated, or remained the same throughout the years?&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Try to add multiple visualizations in the dashboard. Add sliders, dropdowns, and other components for the visualizations. It is your application, after all, customize it to your liking. It will be a great project on your resume!</li>
</ul>

<p>Record a short(1-2 minutes) demo video displaying your Dash app. In the video, show how modifying the components changes the visualizations.&nbsp;Also, explain how the ratio has changed over the years. Upload it to Google Drive and change sharing settings to make it visible to all.</p>

<p>The deadline for the app submission is <strong>March 25, 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>Get Set Build!</p>
